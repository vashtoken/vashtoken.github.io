## 🧬 Why We Embedded Ethereum’s Genesis Block Hash in the Contract

**$VASH (Vitalik Was Here)** is deployed on the **Base** network — a fast and secure Ethereum Layer 2.  
Yet, we chose to embed the **Ethereum Genesis Block hash** as a tribute. 

## 🔧 Key Features

- ✅ ERC-20 standard-compliant
- ✅ Tribute hash stored on-chain
- ✅ Immutable & verified smart contract
- ✅ No external dependencies (no OpenZeppelin)
- ✅ Pure Solidity, easy to verify and understand

## ⚠️ Disclaimers

- **Not affiliated** with Vitalik Buterin or the Ethereum Foundation
- **No utility** – purely a meme & cultural artifact
- **Not a financial instrument** – DYOR, NFA, etc.
